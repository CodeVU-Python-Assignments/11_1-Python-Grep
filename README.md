# PY4E_Mod_11_1_Python_grep
Grep python implementation

Write a simple program to simulate the operation of the grep command on Unix. Ask the user to enter a regular expression and count the number of lines that matched the regular expression. 

The file, named mbox-long.txt is included in this repo.  You will need to do the implementation to open and read through the file in your program.

To test your program use pytest
-- pytest
-- python -m pytest

(Python should be able to find the test file on its own)
